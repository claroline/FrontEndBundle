# angular-data-table [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Swimlane/angular-data-table](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Swimlane/angular-data-table?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

`angular-data-table` is a AngularJS directive for presenting large and complex data.  It has all the features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with _no external depedencies_. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it.

It was engineered from its conception to handle thousands of rows without sacrificing performance.  It was built for modern browsers using _ES6, CSS3 and HTML5_ and only supports [Evergreen Browsers](http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/evergreen-browsers/) and >= 1.4.x Angular.

See live demos [here](http://swimlane.github.io/angular-data-table/).

## Using It

#### Download

- NPM `npm install angular-data-table`
- JSPM `jspm install github:Swimlane/angular-data-table`

or Github download or clone of course!

#### Run Demos

Ensure you have the latest NPM and JSPM installed globally.  If you don't already have JSPM installed run: `npm install jspm -g`.

- `npm install`
- `jspm install`
- `gulp watch serve`
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`

docs coming soon, in the meantime, 'View Source' is your friend ;)!

#### Build

`gulp release` to build Modules, ES5 via Babel and compile.

#### Include

You've got 5 different options to include this in your build depending on your setup.

- `./release/dataTable.js` - A standalone file that was compiled with Babel and EXCLUDES the Babel runtime.
- `./release/dataTable.helpers.js` - A standalone file that was compiled with Babel and INCLUDES the Babel runtime.
- `./release/dataTable.helpers.min.js` - A standalone file that was compiled with Babel, INCLUDES the Babel runtime and is MINIFIED.
- `./release/dataTable.es6.js` - Raw ES6 Version.

There is also the CSS too:

- `./release/dataTable.css` - The base CSS, pretty much required
- `./release/material.css` - Material theme

If none of the above makes any sense just include `./release/dataTable.helpers.min.js` and include the css files referenced above.

#### Usage

Include the module in your angular app module like:

    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [ 'data-table' ]);

    module.controller('HomeController', function($scope){
      $scope.options = {
        scrollbarV: false
      };

      $scope.data = [
        { name: 'Austin', gender: 'Male' },
        { name: 'Marjan', gender: 'Male' }
      ];
    });

then using expressive markup in your template:

    <dtable options="options" rows="data" class="material dt">
      <column name="Name" width="300" flex-grow="2"></column>
      <column name="Gender">
        <strong>{{$row.name}}</strong>: {{$cell}}
      </column>
    </dtable>

and your off to the races! See live demos [here](http://swimlane.github.io/angular-data-table/).

## Research

#### Alternatives

I looked over all the alternatives out there agnostic to any particular platform to find the best solution.  Heres what I came up with:

- [Handsome Table](http://handsontable.github.io/ngHandsontable/) - A great execl-like but lacked the ability to handle 100s of thousands of rows.

- [Angular Grid](http://www.angulargrid.com/) - A great project by a talented developer, however, lacked many of the core features I needed.  Implementing the ones I needed was huge undertaking as some of the core would need to be re-worked.

- [React Fixed Data Table](https://facebook.github.io/fixed-data-table/) - This is probably the BEST table alternative out there.  Its extremely smooth, handles millions of rows flawlessly, has a great API but lacked a few features I needed ( nor am I a react'er ).

- [React Data Grid](https://github.com/zippyui/react-datagrid) - Another great alternative out there for react.

- [Kendo UI Grid](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/index) - Extremely full featured but EXTREMELY HEAVY( 600kb )!

- [UI Grid](http://ui-grid.info) - By far the most popular grid for Angular and has a LOT of features. Problem was I found several bugs ( I'm on a mac, the main devs are windows users ), it supports a ton of browsers ( hacky code and bloat ) and it has a ton of features ( bloat ).

- [Vaadin Poylmer Grid](http://demo.vaadin.com/sampler/#ui/grids-and-trees/grid) - A nice poylmer project but beta-ish.

- [Ember Table](http://addepar.github.io/ember-table/) - A very nice table for Ember but doesn't handle large data sets very nicely and scrolling can be a bit 'janky' sometimes.

#### Design

The core CSS for the table has no assumptions about the styling of your application and therefore you can easily style it.  I provided a out-of-the-box style based on Google Material design.  Here is where I got some of the ideas:

- [Angular Material Github Issue](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/796)
- [Material Table](https://github.com/daniel-nagy/md-data-table)
- [Material Table 2](http://danielnagy.me/md-data-table/)
- [Material Table 3](http://codepen.io/zavoloklom/pen/IGkDz)
- [Material Design Spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/data-tables.html#data-tables-tables-within-cards)
